# Module_mdBook_template

This repo is to be used as the [template](https://github.com/organizations/cccu-uk/repositories/new) for creating module documentation. It uses `mdbook`, which is powered by [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/), therefore some examples and external links point to the [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) documentation.

You can view the mdbook in it's deployed state [here](https://cccu-uk.github.io/Module_mdBook_template/). Once opened, use the contents page on the left-hand side to navigate through the documentation.

Main thing to note is that all your content should be placed inside the the subdirectory `content`, and using subdirectories beneath that to organise your work.
